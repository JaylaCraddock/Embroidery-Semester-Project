                <h1>Butterfly Project</h1>
                <p>This is my last embroidery project that I did for school. It took several months to complete as I
                    used several different colors to create this piece. I traced an image of a butterfly with leaves
                    coming out from the left side and got started on embroidering. The type of stitch that I used are
                    straight mini stitches. This is by far one of my favorite embroidery pieces as it’s very special to
                    me because I worked so hard on this piece everyday and even made sure that the color flowed together
                    with the design. Unfortunately I was not able to find the original black and white pattern that is
                    available to download but, I was able to find one that is similar that you can purchase for a cheap
                    price. </p>
