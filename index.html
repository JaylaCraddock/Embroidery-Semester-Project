            <h1>What is Embroidery?</h1>
            <p>Embroidery is a form of art where it involves decorating fabric using a needle for embroidering using
                embroidery floss. Embroidery comes in two forms: hand embroidery and machine embroidery I
                will be mainly talking about hand embroidery. Embroidery is commonly used for decorating clothing such
                as shirts, hats, blankets and handbags.</p>

        <!-- History of Embroidery -->
        <article id="history">
            <h2>History of Embroidery</h2>

            <h3>30,000 B.C.</h3>
            <p>In the history of hand embroidery it all started over thousands of years ago in the Cro-Magnon
                era or 30,000 B.C. With the origins being tied to Ancient China who were the first to start this craft
                that dated back between the 3rd and 5th centuries with examples also being found in Europe as
                well.
            </p>

            <p>Embroidery was originally made to not create artwork but instead used to repair clothing. But as time
                went on embroidery became more than just a way to repair clothing into a way to convey art that is
                related to a culture or tradition. </p>

                alt="Embroidery design of a female royal sitting down with her small toddler child standing on her lap and is bending down to touch a chalice that an old man wearing a gown is kneeling to the female royal and holding the chalice up to. To the right of the old man kneeling there are two other male royals that are chatting. With three angels above the royals, child and the old man. The people are surrounded by several designs that includes lines, swirls, loops, leaves and other shapes. The background of the fabric is dark red while the design itself is made out of gold.  ">


            <h3>
                Middle Ages
            </h3>
            <p>In the middle ages and the Islamic world, is when embroidery became more of an art with styles such as
                Opus Anglicanum becoming a popular style of embroidery that involves using gold, silk and silver threads
                into clothing and textile arts. With textile arts had embroidery designs that were used as decorations
                to
                showcase wealth. With the rich having access to this type of service made it more special with the
                powerful decorating their homes with tapestries, wall hangings, textiles and gold threads with beautiful
                hand embroidery designs. As well as the Islamic world at places such as Istanbul, Cairo and Damascus
                having embroidered clothes that are found on shoes, tunis, uniforms and robes.</p>

            <h3>
                18th-20th Century
            </h3>
            <p>
                Moving onto the 18th and 20th Century is when embroidery was gaining popularity in Europe with the skill
                being involved in women's education. Making embroidery a very valuable skill to have with it being
                associated with relevant social standing. During this time we were moving into a more industrial
                transformation as during the mid-1800s in France, was when the very first embroidery machine was made by
                Josué Heilmann.
            </p>

            <h3>
                Present Day
            </h3>

            <p>
                Embroidery today is now split into two, you can choose to still do it the traditional way with hand
                embroidery or now with an embroidery machine that does the work for you. Both ways still create
                beautiful designs with hand embroidery being a relaxing hobby to have while watching your favorite video
                at the same time making a design that you want to bring to life. With embroidery machines you can find
                any
                design online and send it to the machine that can replicate the design perfectly and make it in a timely
                fashion.

                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I have some experience with embroidery as I first learned it in my Fashion Design 2 class during my
                    Senior year in highschool. There I discovered how easy and fun it is to turn a design that I like
                    into a beautifully detailed piece that I can use to attach it to any piece of clothing. I
                    quickly found my own style of embroidery where I mostly use a mini straight stitch for the entire
                    design. As much as it does take a lot of time to do, I like seeing how the small details brings
                    together my design as a whole. So far I’ve made about 3 designs as embroidery is very time consuming
                    depending on how detailed I want my design to be. I take my time as I want my design to come out
                    as stunning as possible. I use embroidery as a way to relax and wind down while having a video or my
                    favorite show play while I stitch. I love seeing the final result of all my hard work paying off in
                    a form of art that I can enjoy by framing it or attaching it to my favorite items.</p>
