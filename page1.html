                <h1>My Neighbor Totoro</h1>
                <p>This is my first personal project that I made of the Japanese character Totoro from the movie “My
                    Neighbor Totoro”. I found a picture online and traced it using a pencil onto the piece of fabric and
                    got started on embroidering the pattern onto the fabric. The type of stitching that I used to make
                    Totoro is a mini straight stitch and I was strategic in the colors that I used as I wanted to
                    capture the most accurate design of Totoro. It took me a couple of months to make and was finished
                    in January 2025. </p>
