                <h1>Flowers Project</h1>
                <p>This is my very first embroidery project that I did while learning embroidery in highschool. My
                    fashion design 2 teacher gave me this assignment to do where we used this flower pattern to practice
                    several different stitches. I used a multitude of colors to make the flowers and stems. The several
                    stitches that I used includes; Straight, Woven-Wheel, Detached-Chain, French Knot, Back Stitch and
                    Stem stitches. This project took me about a month to complete and was the beginning of me learning
                    embroidery. </p>
